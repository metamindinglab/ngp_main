# Game Owner Manager Bug Fixes - Implementation Report

## üêõ **Bugs Reported and Fixed**

### **Bug 1: User "Ardy Lee" Seeing All 6 Games Instead of Their Own**
- **Issue**: User with ID "aebc960f-ab0f-4209-a445-e0d179382d2a" was seeing all games instead of just their owned games
- **Root Cause**: Ardy Lee's `gameOwnerId` was `undefined` in the user record, causing the API to fail the ownership query

#### **‚úÖ Fix Implemented:**
1. **Fixed User Record**: Updated Ardy Lee's user record with a proper `gameOwnerId`
2. **Mapped Unassigned Games**: Assigned the 2 unassigned games to Ardy Lee
3. **Added Fallback Logic**: Enhanced the games API to handle `undefined` gameOwnerIds gracefully

#### **Technical Changes:**
- Created `scripts/fix-ardy-ownership.ts` to fix the ownership mapping
- Updated `src/app/api/game-owner/games/route.ts` with proper `gameOwnerId` validation
- Added fallback to return empty games list when user has no valid `gameOwnerId`

#### **Result:**
- ‚úÖ Ardy Lee now owns exactly **2 games**: "Escape to Freedom [FULL GAME!]" and "Metaminding Demo #2"
- ‚úÖ All other users own their correct games (1 game each)
- ‚úÖ No more cross-contamination of game ownership

---

### **Bug 2: "View Game" Button Inconsistent Behavior**
- **Issue**: Some games would open Roblox URLs correctly, others would stay on the same page
- **Root Cause**: Invalid or empty `robloxLink` values in the database

#### **‚úÖ Fix Implemented:**
1. **URL Validation**: Added proper URL validation and formatting in the games API
2. **Visual Feedback**: Added disabled state for games without valid Roblox links
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback for invalid URLs

#### **Technical Changes:**
```typescript
// Enhanced URL handling in games API
let robloxLink = game.robloxLink || '#'
if (robloxLink !== '#' && !robloxLink.startsWith('http')) {
  robloxLink = `https://${robloxLink}`
}

// Dashboard button improvements
<Link 
  href={game.robloxLink} 
  target="_blank" 
  rel="noopener noreferrer"
  className={game.robloxLink === '#' ? 'pointer-events-none opacity-50' : ''}
>
  <Button 
    variant="outline" 
    size="sm"
    disabled={game.robloxLink === '#'}
  >
    View Game
  </Button>
</Link>
```

#### **Result:**
- ‚úÖ Games with valid URLs open in new tabs correctly
- ‚úÖ Games without URLs show disabled button state
- ‚úÖ No more confusion about button behavior

---

### **Bug 3: "Manage" Button Not Working**
- **Issue**: The "Manage" button was not functional - should allow game owners to edit game information
- **Root Cause**: No backend API or frontend pages were implemented for game management

#### **‚úÖ Fix Implemented:**
1. **Created Game Management Page**: Full-featured edit form at `/game-owner/games/[id]/manage`
2. **Implemented Backend APIs**: GET and PUT endpoints for individual game management
3. **Added Security**: Ownership verification to ensure users can only edit their own games

#### **New Features Created:**

**Frontend (`src/app/game-owner/games/[id]/manage/page.tsx`):**
- Complete game editing form with validation
- Real-time feedback for save operations
- Proper navigation and breadcrumbs
- Form fields: Name, Description, Genre, Roblox Link, Thumbnail URL

**Backend (`src/app/api/game-owner/games/[id]/route.ts`):**
- `GET /api/game-owner/games/[id]` - Fetch single game with ownership verification
- `PUT /api/game-owner/games/[id]` - Update game with ownership verification
- Complete error handling and security checks

**Dashboard Integration:**
```typescript
<Link href={`/game-owner/games/${game.id}/manage`}>
  <Button variant="outline" size="sm">
    <Settings className="h-4 w-4 mr-2" />
    Manage
  </Button>
</Link>
```

#### **Security Features:**
- ‚úÖ Authentication required for all operations
- ‚úÖ Ownership verification before allowing edits
- ‚úÖ Session validation on every request
- ‚úÖ Proper error messages for unauthorized access

#### **Result:**
- ‚úÖ Game owners can now edit their game information
- ‚úÖ Changes are saved to the database immediately
- ‚úÖ Real-time feedback for successful saves
- ‚úÖ Secure access control ensuring users can only edit their own games
