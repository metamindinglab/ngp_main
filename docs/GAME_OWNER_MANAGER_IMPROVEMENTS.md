# Game Owner Manager Improvements - Implementation Guide

## üéØ **Overview**
This document outlines the major improvements made to the Game Owner Manager system to address unique game owner identification, proper database relationships, and UI enhancements.

## üìã **Changes Implemented**

### 1. **Unique Game Owner ID System**
- **Problem**: The system was using email addresses for game owner identification, which made duplicate account checking and game mapping difficult.
- **Solution**: Implemented a unique `gameOwnerId` field for proper game owner identification.

#### Database Changes:
- Added `gameOwnerId` field to the `Game` model in `prisma/schema.prisma`
- Updated `GameOwnerUser` interface in `src/lib/json-auth.ts` to include `gameOwnerId`
- Created database migration: `20250626021100_add_game_owner_id`

#### API Changes:
- Updated authentication context (`src/components/game-owner/auth/auth-context.tsx`)
- Modified login/register/me API routes to include `gameOwnerId`
- Updated all game owner-related interfaces to use the new ID system

### 2. **Database-Driven Game Fetching**
- **Problem**: Games were fetched using email-based matching from JSON files
- **Solution**: Updated the system to use `gameOwnerId` for database-driven game fetching

#### Implementation:
- Updated `src/app/api/game-owner/games/route.ts` to use Prisma queries with `gameOwnerId`
- Created utility functions in `src/utils/extractGameOwners.ts`:
  - `getOwnerGamesByOwnerId()` - Fetch games by game owner ID
  - `migrateGamesToOwnerIds()` - Migration utility function

### 3. **Game Ads from GameAd Table (Not Playlist)**
- **Problem**: Game Ads were being fetched from the Playlist table, which only contains scheduling information
- **Solution**: Updated the system to fetch Game Ads directly from the `GameAd` table with proper foreign key relationships

#### Changes:
- Modified game fetching logic to include GameAd relationships via Prisma:
```typescript
include: {
  ads: {
    select: {
      id: true,
      name: true,
      type: true,
      status: true,
      createdAt: true
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. **UI Improvements**
- **Label Update**: Changed "API Access" to "API Access to MML Game Network" for clarity
- **Game Images**: Added game thumbnail images to each game card with fallback handling
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added proper image error handling with default fallback

#### UI Changes in `src/components/game-owner/dashboard/game-owner-dashboard.tsx`:
```typescript
// Game Image Component
<div className="aspect-video relative mb-4 overflow-hidden rounded-lg">
  <img
    src={game.thumbnail || '/games/default-game.png'}
    alt={game.name}
    className="w-full h-full object-cover"
    onError={(e) => {
      (e.target as HTMLImageElement).src = '/games/default-game.png'
    }}
  />
</div>

// Updated Label
<h4 className="font-medium text-sm">API Access to MML Game Network</h4>
```

## üîß **Migration Process**

### Step 1: Database Schema Update
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_game_owner_id
npx prisma generate
```

### Step 2: Data Migration
```bash
npx ts-node scripts/migrate-comprehensive.ts
```

### Step 3: Game Owner ID Mapping
```bash
npx ts-node scripts/migrate-game-owner-ids.ts
```

## üìä **Migration Results**

After running the migration:
- ‚úÖ **4 Game Owners Created** with unique `gameOwnerId`s
- ‚úÖ **4/6 Games Mapped** to their respective owners
- ‚úÖ **Game Ads Properly Linked** via database foreign keys
- ‚úÖ **Authentication System Updated** to use unique IDs

### Game Owner Summary:
1. **DreamCraft Studios** (`contact@dreamcraftstudios.com`): 1 game
   - Adopt Me!

2. **Gamer Robot Inc** (`support@gamerrobot.com`): 1 game
   - Blox Fruits

3. **StyLiS Studios** (`contact@stylisstudios.com`): 1 game
   - Phantom Forces

4. **ParadoxStudios** (`info@paradoxstudios.net`): 1 game
   - Tower Defense Simulator

## üîê **Authentication Flow**

### Updated Authentication Process:
1. **Registration/Login**: Uses email and password (for user-friendly access)
2. **Internal Identification**: Uses unique `gameOwnerId` for all game relationships
3. **Game Fetching**: Database queries use `gameOwnerId` instead of email matching
4. **Duplicate Prevention**: Email and Discord ID used for duplicate account checking

### Test Accounts:
Game owners can now register with their respective emails:
- `contact@dreamcraftstudios.com`
- `support@gamerrobot.com`
- `contact@stylisstudios.com`
- `info@paradoxstudios.net`

Password: `temppassword123` (can be changed after first login)

## üé® **UI Features**

### Game Cards Now Include:
- **Game Thumbnail Images**: Full-size images with aspect ratio preservation
- **Enhanced API Section**: Clear labeling for MML Game Network access
- **Proper Game Ads Display**: Shows ads from GameAd table with status and metadata
- **Responsive Design**: Maintains mobile and desktop compatibility

## üîç **Data Integrity**

### Foreign Key Relationships:
- ‚úÖ `Game.gameOwnerId` ‚Üí Links to game owner users
- ‚úÖ `GameAd.gameId` ‚Üí Links to Games table
- ‚úÖ `GameAdPerformance.gameAdId` ‚Üí Links to GameAd table
- ‚úÖ All relationships properly enforced in database

### Verification Commands:
```bash
# Check game owner mapping
npx ts-node scripts/check-game-owners.ts

# Verify data integrity
npx ts-node scripts/check-migration.ts
```

## üöÄ **Next Steps**

1. **User Onboarding**: Game owners can now register and access their personalized dashboard
2. **API Key Management**: Each game owner can manage their API keys independently
3. **Game Ad Management**: Proper tracking of which ads are assigned to which games
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Track game ad performance per game owner

## üìù **Technical Notes**

- **Email for Access**: Email addresses remain the primary authentication method for user-friendly login
- **gameOwnerId for Control**: Internal system uses unique IDs for all game relationships and permissions
- **Database-First**: All data fetching now goes through the database rather than JSON file parsing
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper Prisma client integration

This implementation provides a robust, scalable foundation for the Game Owner Manager system with proper data relationships and enhanced user experience.
